# KellenMurphy
Welcome to my personal repository for showcasing the knowledge I have learned and how I have applied it. 
This repo is always a WIP as the learning proccess is never done! The content can range from coding projects to blog posts containing my journey through learning cybersecurity. Pretty much anything I see fit that I would like to share with potential employers/collaboraters. 

About Me: (Lots of overlap with my resume if that applies to you)

Name: Kellen F. Murphy
Education: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at San Diego State University (In Progress as of May 2024) 

Things I know: 
- Coding Languages: C, C++, Java, Haskell, Prolog, (Python and its packages to a lesser extent)
- Tools: Command Line (-nix type distros), VIM (a recent convert :) ), CLion, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, VMWare
- Other:
- Setting up Virtual enviroments for cyber testing (Fun stuff!)
- 

Things I am learning:
- Metasploit (Learning about different payloads and how to effectively use the software to conduct effective pentesting)
- Splunk (How to navigate the software) & (How to genereate, understand, and organize telemetry in a presentable way for less technical decision makers)
- WireShark (Baby steps, learning how to navigate it and understand what it does/can do in the right hands) 

Things I would like to learn: 
- Bash scripting
- Standard Cybersecurity protocols, jargon, and strategies (MITRE Att&ck Framework comes to mind)
- Networking fundamentals (Fall 2024 semester here we come!)
- Basic WebDev (Hopefully a personal website soon)

Thats all for now! Regular updates should come in as I learn and apply more.
